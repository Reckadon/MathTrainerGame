# MathTrainerGame
My first full fledged app(Game), uses firebase as its database and has a really good UI and design! 
Login or register to the game and then you are greeted with a beautiful UI and can select difficulties and much more.
Has a About section, a Change username option on the first screen or the main menu along with a help button at the bottom left.
2nd screen is the main game, the game generates random numbers with operators according to the difficulty u chose and you have 60 seconds to answer as many as u can!
Climb up the LeaderBoard and and see yourself defeating others :)
PS: I am a 15 year old and i do programming and app development as my hobby so plz judge accordingly!
Thanks!
